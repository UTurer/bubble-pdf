During my employment for Ekinoks-AG, I made this app for the quality control team because they "stamped bubbles near dimensions to be measured in physical copies of technical drawings, wrote numbers with a ballpen inside the bubbles and then scan the document" to obtain a digital drawing with numbered bubbles and they needed a faster method.

With this app one can import a pdf, then with the mouse pointer and "Insert" key, one can insert a numbered bubble near the mouse pointer. The first press of "Insert" key places the bubble. The second press of "Insert key places the arrow. "Delete" key deletes the last created bubble. Colors, text and the keys can be changed using Preferences.
